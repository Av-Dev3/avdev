          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Hi, I’m Alex. For the last nine years, I’ve worked in the service
            industry, learning how to stay calm under pressure, solve problems
            fast, and deal with just about every kind of situation you can
            imagine. But behind the scenes, I’ve always been drawn to tech. I’d
            stay up late tinkering with websites, teaching myself code, and
            dreaming about doing this for real one day.
          </p>

          <p>
            That day finally came. I decided to stop treating this like a hobby
            and start treating it like my future.
          </p>

          <p>
            Right now, I’m focused on becoming a full stack web developer. I’ve
            been building projects from the ground up with HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, and I recently started working with databases and
            backend tools like Supabase. I’m creating real tools I actually use,
            like a productivity planner to help me stay on track.
          </p>

          <p>
            This site is part of my learning journey. I’m not taking on any work
            just yet since I’m still in the process of leveling up, but I wanted
            to put this out there anyway. I believe in building in public and
            keeping things honest.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of coding, I’m probably bowling, working a shift, or just
            trying to improve a little every day. Thanks for checking out my
            site. There’s more to come.
